This is my journal of the design and building process of **Combination Lock Breaker**.

## 10/7/2025 - Part Planning & Research  

Spent a few hours researching what parts I mainly need and what goes together.

- Arduino Nano (Main control module)
- Double Shaft Stepper Motor (Turns the dial, dual shaft so I can mount an encoder at the back)
- Optical Rotary Encoder (Allows for even more precise control, and accounts for missed steps, etc)
- Stepper Motor Driver (Module controlling the stepper motor)
- Voltage Regulator (Regulates the 5v to the analog feedback servo)
- Analog Feedback Servo (Opens the shaft)
- LCD Display (Shows you the interface)
- Matrix Keypad (Lets you interact with the interface)

I also would like to see if making my own pcb for this project is possible, I'll do some more research.

Next I'll need to find cheap but good parts, add any missing things needed, and calculate the total price, then I will move onto designing the project.

## 10/8/2025 3 AM - Rough idea on things  

- For my parts, I decided to switch out the voltage regulator for a buck converter. I did this because a buck converter has better efficiency and is better at heat management.
- I'm also switching out the arduino nano for a arduino mega since the nano doesn't have enough pins for the amount of wires I need to hook up to it, and the extra specs that the mega would give me would prevent any low memory issues I could run into in the future.

- Added Ceramic and Electrolytic capacitors
- Added Fuses

Here's a CirkitDesigner diagram I'm working on for now. (The design isn't complete yet and isn't 100% accurate). Next, I'm going to learn KiCad for schematic and PCB Designs

## 10/8/2025 9 PM - Part Updates + Installed KiCad  

- Finished the BOM for now (not including PCB or 3D printing costs yet)
- I replaced the stepper motor, encoder, and driver with an enclosed system I found on StepperOnline.ca. This not only simplified half the project for me, it was a couple bucks cheaper than my old parts too.
- Since I need more power for my new stepper motor, I will be using a 24V wall adapter with DC pigtails: female to project, male to Arduino.
- I'm also going to use 2 buck/step-down converters now, one will supply 7â€“12V to the Arduino's DC port, and the other will supply 5V to the other parts.
- I'm using a separate step down converter for the servo to handle voltage and current spikes when it hits the lock's shackle, which is also why I can't power it using the arduinos 5V pin as it has a chance to damage the board.


For now I'll be following some tutorials on KiCad. Once I'm comfortable, I will start to make the designs for my project.

```
[24V Wall Adapter] ---------> [Stepper Driver] > [Stepper Motor + Encoder]
                            |
                            ---------> [Step-Down 9V] -> [Arduino Mega]
                                                            |
                                                            [5V Pin] --> [LCD Display]

[24V Wall Adapter] -----> [Step-Down 5V]
                                |
                                --> [Analog Feedback Servo]
```

## 10/9/2025 2 AM - Future Plans  

This project is going to take way longer than I thought it would. Probably because this is my first hardware project and I have zero clue what I'm doing.

Anyways, since I'm getting tired of KiCad tutorials, I'll start working on my readme file instead. I need to do more research about my parts so I can find where I should put the capacitors and fuses, if I even need them in some areas.

An issue I currently have is that I need a multimeter to properly adjust the potentiometers on my XL4015 step down converters, which I don't have. I'll probably borrow one when needed.

## 10/9/2025 3 AM - Other considerations  

I know I'm going to get a ton of power and speed from my Nema 17 motor, but I have a new concern about if my servo is going to slow down my setup. Considering the servo will have to move very fast, and that it will have to attempt to open the shackle a few hundred or even thousands of times before stopping, I'm also concerned about the durability of the servo, I don't know if it can take that many hits.

I also really need a better name for this device, "Combination Lock Breaker" doesn't really cut it.


Here's a quick recap of what I did for the past hour
- Created readme file
- Looked at other designs of combination lock breakers, and demos
- Drafted new ideas for the future (adding a progress bar, status, etc to the display and creating more input options with the keypad)
