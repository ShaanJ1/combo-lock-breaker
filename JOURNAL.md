## 10/7/2025 3 PM - Part Planning & Research  

Spent a few hours researching what parts I mainly need and what goes together.

- Arduino Nano (Main control module)
- Double Shaft Stepper Motor (Turns the dial, dual shaft so I can mount an encoder at the back)
- Optical Rotary Encoder (Allows for even more precise control, and accounts for missed steps, etc)
- Stepper Motor Driver (Module controlling the stepper motor)
- Voltage Regulator (Regulates the 5v to the analog feedback servo)
- Analog Feedback Servo (Opens the shaft)
- LCD Display (Shows you the interface)
- Matrix Keypad (Lets you interact with the interface)

I also would like to see if making my own pcb for this project is possible, I'll do some more research.

Next I'll need to find cheap but good parts, add any missing things needed, and calculate the total price, then I will move onto designing the project.

## 10/7/2025 9 PM - Rough idea on things  

- For my parts, I decided to switch out the voltage regulator for a buck converter. I did this because a buck converter has better efficiency and is better at heat management.
- I'm also switching out the arduino nano for a arduino mega since the nano doesn't have enough pins for the amount of wires I need to hook up to it, and the extra specs that the mega would give me would prevent any low memory issues I could run into in the future.

- Added Ceramic and Electrolytic capacitors
- Added Fuses

Here's a CirkitDesigner diagram I'm working on for now. (The design isn't complete yet and isn't 100% accurate). Next, I'm going to learn KiCad for schematic and PCB Designs

## 10/8/2025 3 PM - Part Updates + Installed KiCad  

- Finished the BOM for now (not including PCB or 3D printing costs yet)
- I replaced the stepper motor, encoder, and driver with an enclosed system I found on StepperOnline.ca. This not only simplified half the project for me, it was a couple bucks cheaper than my old parts too.
- Since I need more power for my new stepper motor, I will be using a 24V wall adapter with DC pigtails: female to project, male to Arduino.
- I'm also going to use 2 buck/step-down converters now, one will supply 7â€“12V to the Arduino's DC port, and the other will supply 5V to the other parts.
- I'm using a separate step down converter for the servo to handle voltage and current spikes when it hits the lock's shackle, which is also why I can't power it using the arduinos 5V pin as it has a chance to damage the board.


For now I'll be following some tutorials on KiCad. Once I'm comfortable, I will start to make the designs for my project.

```
[24V Wall Adapter] ---------> [Stepper Driver] > [Stepper Motor + Encoder]
                            |
                            ---------> [Step-Down 9V] -> [Arduino Mega]
                                                            |
                                                            [5V Pin] --> [LCD Display]

[24V Wall Adapter] -----> [Step-Down 5V]
                                |
                                --> [Analog Feedback Servo]
```

## 10/8/2025 8 PM - Future Plans  

This project is going to take way longer than I thought it would. Probably because this is my first hardware project and I have zero clue what I'm doing.

Anyways, since I'm getting tired of KiCad tutorials, I'll start working on my readme file instead. I need to do more research about my parts so I can find where I should put the capacitors and fuses, if I even need them in some areas.

An issue I currently have is that I need a multimeter to properly adjust the potentiometers on my XL4015 step down converters, which I don't have. I'll probably borrow one when needed.

## 10/8/2025 9 PM - Other considerations  

I know I'm going to get a ton of power and speed from my Nema 17 motor, but I have a new concern about if my servo is going to slow down my setup. Considering the servo will have to move very fast, and that it will have to attempt to open the shackle a few hundred or even thousands of times before stopping, I'm also concerned about the durability of the servo, I don't know if it can take that many hits.

I also really need a better name for this device, "Combination Lock Breaker" doesn't really cut it.


Here's a quick recap of what I did for the past hour
- Created readme file
- Looked at other designs of combination lock breakers, and demos
- Drafted new ideas for the future (adding a progress bar, status, etc to the display and creating more input options with the keypad)

## 10/9/2025 - Created a 3D lock model  

I created my combination lock model in Fusion 360. I found the dimensions of my specific lock online, but there were some missing measurements like for the dial and width of the lock so I had to measure the parts with a ruler. I'm not gonna make it super polished and good looking just yet, I just want the base idea of how everything will pan out.

I could've finished this model in less than an hour, but my Fusion kept crashing for some reason which slowed me down.

## 10/10/2025 - Creating mounts  

My current plan is to create mounts for each similar part (Keypad + LCD, Motor + Lock, etc), then I'll group them all together into one final design. I'm not that experienced in 3D modelling, so theres probably a better way to do this.

![image.png](https://blueprint.hackclub.com/user-attachments/blobs/proxy/eyJfcmFpbHMiOnsiZGF0YSI6MTUwOCwicHVyIjoiYmxvYl9pZCJ9fQ==--7ed135812b2fb258fd081d1cd8f79a02ebd2f4e7/image.png)

The past hour or so I've been downloading all the 3D models of the parts that I'm going to use in my project, organising my project directory, and making the LCD mount. Now I'm in the process of adding the keypad.

![image.png](https://blueprint.hackclub.com/user-attachments/blobs/proxy/eyJfcmFpbHMiOnsiZGF0YSI6MTUwNywicHVyIjoiYmxvYl9pZCJ9fQ==--c7a29624a0aa1a0c5f37c14fa64640002df1afa9/image.png)
Still haven't really figured out the screws in Fusion yet

I want my final design to allow for the lock to be easily swappable, keep the entire thing compact, while still being able to see the action. Similar to something like this

## 10/11/2025 - Day 5  

### New ideas of how my project is going to function
For my servo, I will need to program it in a way that helps prevent excess damage by hitting the shackle full force every time. Cutting power as soon as it detects the servo hits a lot of resistance, and adding a capacitor to the servo are some ideas I have right now.
![image.png](https://blueprint.hackclub.com/user-attachments/blobs/proxy/eyJfcmFpbHMiOnsiZGF0YSI6MTY3MywicHVyIjoiYmxvYl9pZCJ9fQ==--3b185be5a05c2a3ffe001d22fa10327b438795e5/image.png)

The design also needs good cooling, especially for the buck converters, so I need some additional heatsinks for that too.


#### Currently working on/plan for the day
- Schematic for the project
- Creating footprints and symbols for the parts
- Making the coupler for the motor and for the dial
- The part that will hold the lock securely in place

## 10/12/2025 10 AM - Change of plans  

Instead of having an arduino mega + pcb setup, I'm going to go ahead and make my own devboard to both reduce space and to simplify wiring. My top 2 options are currently the RP2040 and the ESP32.

After some consideration, I went ahead and chose the RP2040 module for this project over the ESP32. I liked the ESP32's chip for its wifi capabilities but ultimately chose the RP2040 because it consumes less power and has better overall hardware control. Since I also already have an LCD and Matrix keypad for my project, running a web server would've just been unnecessary overhead.

## 10/12/2025 3 PM - Created the coupler  

Finished created the coupler for my motor & lock. I made teeth on the inside for the dial by measuring out the teeth on my lock as precisely as I could with my ruler since I don't have an electric caliper. The coupler's teeth should be aligned directly with the teeth on the dial so there's minimal slipping and to ensure a good fit.

## 10/13/2025 2 PM - Created the power schematic  

Along with creating a new devboard, I dropped the XL4015 buck converter idea and went ahead with the XL1509 and the MCP1700 modules for my setup to save more space.

The board is going to have 2 sources of power, a USB-C Receptacle, and a Barrel Jack. The USB-C would mainly be used for programming the board but it can also be used to power all the components besides the stepper motor setup. The barrel jack will be the main source of the power for this board, as it provides the 24V necessary for everything to work.

## 10/13/2025 5 PM - Finished the main RP2040 schematic sheet  

After reading a bit of the Hardware Design with the RP2040 and following some parts of Kai Pereira's guide on creating a devboard I was creating and finishing up on my schematic for the microcontroller. Everything was going good until my PC decided to randomly crash and have me lose most of my progress. The recovery file thing that KiCad has didn't work so I had to redo half of my work again which slowed me down a bit.

Nevertheless I finished the schematic and now all thats left is to create the schematic for all my peripherals then I'll be able to move onto my PCB designing.
